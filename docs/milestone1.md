# Innovative Idea

Why trade NFT’s when you can trade those fresh pairs of Trainers? Introducing “Sneaker Wars” where you can create an account and get your shoes on the market. Create your profile and interact with all other traders and browse through the hottest pairs on the market and learn more about them. The website would allow you to create a list of shoes you own, shoes you used to own, and shoes you want which could be added to your favorite list. User profiles would include the list of traders and friends you have exchanged in the past so you can explore their profiles in the future. Boast your collection and share your taste with the world, maybe cop a fresh pair for yourself! Filter from thousands of colors, sizes, and brands. Barter, sell, and be a part of the war!

# Important Data

For Sneaker Wars we could have users log in to create/edit their own profile and interact via comment/rating/like/friend, but be able to view others profiles and sneaker info without having to log in. this would make it easy to give someone your profile url and let them see your collection/activity without them needing to sign up. In your user profile, you can create a list of shoes you own, shoes you used to own, shoes you want, shoes you're trading, and favorite shoes. along with these lists, user profiles could include a profile picture, bio, friend list, and user name. we can also make a page for each sneaker using information from StockX or a similar sneaker market's API including info like retail price, release date, image, name & colorway... etc.

# User Interface

Provide a description and images of the user interface your
application will intend on supporting.

![example image](imgs/UI_home.png)

The above image is a screenshot of our application's home page. On the left, you can see the drop down menu which directs you to different parts of our application. In the center, you can see areas where you can start multiple discussions, debates, or polls. The top right corner contains buttons that will allow you to sign up or log in.

![example image](imgs/UI_user.png)

The above image is a screenshot of the page where you can edit your Discourz profile. This page allows you to upload a photo of yourself, which will be visible to other users. There are text boxes for first name, last name and a short description of yourself. Below that, you can enter your city and use simple drop down menus to select the state and country you live in.

![example image](imgs/UI_Poll.png)

The above image is a screenshot of the page where you can take polls with an example poll question. The question appears on the top and below it are several options for you to choose in the poll with a button next to them. Below the options are bars with percentages showing what the results of the poll are at that moment in time.

![example image](imgs/UI_discussion.png)

The above image is a screenshot of the discussion page of our application with an example discussion in the chat box. This allows you to have a discussion about a certain topic with multiple people in one chat box. On the right side of the page, you can see all the people currently in this discussion (up to 12 including yourself). The different colored messages allow you to distinguish who is talking with ease, and the text box on the bottom allows you to type your own message. There is also a search bar in the upper right that allows the user to search for people to potentially add to the disucssion.

![example image](imgs/UI_debate.png)

The above image is a screenshot of the debate page of our application with an example debate in the chat box. This page looks very similar to the discussion page, except for the fact that you can only talk to one person at a time. As in the discussion page, the colors of the messages are different colors for different people talking. There is also a text box at the bottom of the page for sending your message to the person you are debating.
