Idea:
Why trade NFT’s when you can trade those fresh pairs of Trainers? Introducing “Sneaker Wars” where you can create an account and get your shoes on the market. Create your profile and interact with all other traders and browse through the hottest pairs on the market and learn more about them. The website would allow you to create a list of shoes you own, shoes you used to own, and shoes you want which could be added to your favorite list. User profiles would include the list of traders and friends you have exchanged in the past so you can explore their profiles in the future. Boast your collection and share your taste with the world, maybe cop a fresh pair for yourself! Filter from thousands of colors, sizes, and brands. Barter, sell, and be a part of the war!
