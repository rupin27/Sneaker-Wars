The goal of this website was to allow users to interact with all other traders and browse through the latest and most renowned shoe pairs on the market and learn more about them. The website would allow you to create a list of shoes that you own, shoes you used to own, and shoes you want which could be added to your favorite list. It allows you to look through other users' tastes and somehow share and distribute culture through the means of sneakers.<br>
<br> The target audience for our application is people who are interested in sneakers, whether they are a seasoned collector, or they are just getting into the hobby.<i> Uncover the features of our app in the video below.</i><br>
